# Instructions

Look through the cards, and click on the ones you want to pull up to the top of the page in order to compare them.  They can be removed by clicking on either the card in the main section, or on the card in the compare section.  searching for a card will filter out the cards that are displayed on the page.

# Thoughts and reflections

My goals in this project were to create a fully functional application while only using one stateful component. I successfully achieved this goal to my satisfaction. I am incredibly happy with my final result and feel I have a solid grasp on React in general. 

When working on this project I did run into some troubles by not having state specifically in my card.js file, but I was able to find a creative way to remedy this problem and ultimately I think the code is cleaner and more effecient because of it.  

Testing was certainly a challenge, but once I got on a roll with it, it all made sense.

Finally I was really glad this was an individual project.  It was really helpful to have to do it all to move forward in my react studies.
