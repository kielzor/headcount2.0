# Thoughts and reflections

My goals in this project were to create a fully functional application while only using one stateful component. I successfully achieved this goal to my satisfaction. I am incredibly happy with my final result and feel I have a solid grasp on React in general. 

When working on this project I did run into some troubles by not having state specifically in my card.js file, but I was able to find a creative way to remedy this problem and ultimately I think the code is cleaner and more effecient because of it.  

Testing was certainly a challenge, but once I got on a roll with it, it all made sense.

Finally I was really glad this was an individual project.  It was really helpful to have to do it all to move forward in my react studies.

# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.  

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.  

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a `DistrictRepository` class. After you finish `iteration 1` you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through [the documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.  

## Set Up

Fork this project

Run `npm install` from the root directory

Run `npm start` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser

You can begin running your tests with `npm test`

## Project Goals

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
